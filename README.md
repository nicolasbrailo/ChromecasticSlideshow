# ChromecasticSlideshow

Slideshows in Chromecast directly from your filesystem, without going through any online service. No Google Photos, Facebook or anything else: plain old random files straight from your disk to your Chromecast.

Specify a local path with your pictures, a device to cast to and voila, instant slideshow from your local network.
